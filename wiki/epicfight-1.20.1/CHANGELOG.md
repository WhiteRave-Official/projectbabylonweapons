  as Item Auto Switching option, an old config where automatically sets player
  mode depending on the item that player holds

### Changed

  optimizing whether key down checks are performed per tick, by adapting
  Minecraft vanilla `KeyMapping`, which may also potentially fix other compatibility issues with other mods.
